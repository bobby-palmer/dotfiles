# My Dot files
Repo to track my personal dot files. 

## Nvim
Very minimal neovim configuration that aims to have enough features for what I do, while also feeling lightweight and intuitive

#### Plugins
- Lsp
- Cmp
- Mason installer
- Telescope
- Tokyo night theme

## Kitty
Light configuration for colors and font

## Fish
My favorite shell. My configuration is mostly variables except for setting vim mode
