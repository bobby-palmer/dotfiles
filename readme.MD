# My Dot files
Repo to track my minimalist dot files. 

## Setup
Clone this repo into ~/ Then, run `stow . --dotfiles` to symlink the configuration to the root directory

## Nvim TODO's
- LSP Diagnostics toggle popups and ghost text
- More pickers (fzf)
- Nicer key binds (lsp, fzf)
- Autopairs could be better

## end goal (in order of importance)
- Maximize ability to jump around without bloat
- Minimize the number of keystrokes and mental overhead to code
- Nice diagnostics to quickly fix issues
- Tooling integration for fast setup (CMake, Make)
